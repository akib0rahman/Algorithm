Brute force method simply means that try out all the alternatives 
until you are exhausted of options. If the problem is solvable,
you will eventually find an answer.

For example, imagine you have a small padlock with 4 digits, 
each from 0-9.Unfortunately, you forgot your combination.
So you set all the numbers back to 0 and try them one by one:
0001, 0002, 0003, and so on until it opens. In the worst case 
scenario, it would take 10^4, or 10,000 tries to find your 
combination.
